LLMariner takes ControlPlane-Worker model. The control plane gets a request and gives instructions to the worker while the worker processes a task such as inference.

Both components can operate within a single cluster, but if you want to utilize GPU resources across multiple clusters, they can also be installed on multiple clusters.
